# speaking-numbers
Project on identifying numbers and tone-of-voice from human audio samples.

This Jupyter Notebook runs from top to bottom, but requires the correct dataset to work (which I no longer have access to). The dataset was provided by Queen Mary University and contained 20,000 audio samples.

This project was originaly completed in April 2021.
